Entities contain components
These components contains data

Systems operate on entities with specific components

Some components are serializable, some are not
Some components are network serializable, some are not

EntityManager is responsible for creating and destroying entities
EntityContainers are customizable containers that hold entity references based on components. This is where i.e. 2d grids, 3d grids, quadmapping and octomapping would be implemented.
