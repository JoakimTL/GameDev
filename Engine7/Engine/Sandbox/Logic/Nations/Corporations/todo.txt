Corporations are entities which may own buildings and in turn employ people. The corporations are also owned by people.

How corporations structure themselves have implication for competitiveness. A large corporation which owns all steps of a production line may have higher margins and thus earn more. They can also outcompete smaller corporations by being larger, having a technology advantage, being more efficient (lower wages, utilizing slavery, etc...) or simply being able to undercut the competition.

Corporations begin taking form when charters and other technologies and cultural movements begin realizing themselves. Although corporations is a modern term, they simply refer to companies which act as their own unique entity.

Corporations can be privately owned, publicly traded or state-owned. They can also be owned by other corporations.

The goal of a corporation is to maximize sales and increase margins. Hopefully corporations can become a major part of the economy and thus a major part of the game, which then can simulate market booms and crashes.

To allow this to occur, corporations need to be able to take out loans. 

Corporations should also be allowed to exist in multiple population centers and nations.
