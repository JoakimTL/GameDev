Having looked at currencies and bartering, the next step is taxation.

Taxation as a concept can arrive in many forms. Usually it forms when a class system is established. The working class then pay taxes to the ruling class.

Taxes can also come from religion, such as tithes. Taxes on the people influence their standard of living somewhat. Poor people with no excess will be hit hardest by taxes. Rich people will not be hit as hard.

Taxes are determined by the player. In the age of commodity bartering taxes can be a list of commodities in certain percentages.

The government can levy taxes on almost anything.
