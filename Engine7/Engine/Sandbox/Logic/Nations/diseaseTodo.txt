Diseases impact the population, economy and wars. In the game we can use known diseases, but perhaps also invent a few new ones for each game.

Diseases can be native to humans or transferred from animals to humans. Most diseases native to humans are mild and can cause productivity loss, but not permanent damage.
Once animals are domesticated more severe diseases might appear. Before the game starts the list of diseases are predetermined and which animal bears them.
