Animals and beasts of burden can be crucial for human innovation. Species are native to landmasses. If there are multiple large landmasses then the species might not be discovered until the nation discovers the landmass or the animal is brought over.

This can create scenarios where nations on a continent can't use horses, or other beasts of burden, as they don't exist in their environment. This forces the nations to adopt their own solutions, which can be interesting for gameplay.
