Technologies are often about an idea and refining it.

For material technologies I think allowing for multiple materials for the same thing makes sense, because evidence of the idea before the appropriate material exists.

For vessels you could form it out of stone, or with pottery and form vases and bowls. The idea is just refined with another material.

How can I reflect this in the tech tree?
