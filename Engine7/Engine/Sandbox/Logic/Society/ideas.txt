	Have a barometer which says how sedentary the tribe is. The more sedentary the faster you research sedentary living technologies, but the more unrest you get. If the tribe is very sedentary you can't move the tribe as often, as you now have a need to stay at the same place.

	We will go with the model of population density being the reason for sedentary living. The more people learn of animal husbandry and plant cultivation the more food they produce, but the more sedentary they become. In the beginning this will take the shape of longer and longer travel time for the tribe, and eventually it will become a system of semi permanent settlements the tribe moves between. Eventually the tribe grows to a size which can no longer be sustained by hunting and gathering and the switch to agriculture must happen, otherwise people will starve to death.
	If the move doesn't happen that time the tribe shrinks and becomes more mobile.
	If the move happens the tribe transitions to a sedentary settlement.

	Society grows because of the needs of people. When people are fed, they might yearn for shelter. When people have shelter they might yearn for religion.

	A form of hierarchy will eventually develop. It should be possible for the player to manipulate this, but not control it.
	The hierarchy will eventually develop into a form of government.
	The hierarchy and the people will have wants and desires which the player will need to attend to. People higher up in the hierarchy might force the player to do things that might not benefit everyone in the tribe/city.

	The heirarchy WILL form over time as a result of the player's actions. The player's actions can only control what the nation gets out of having the hierarchy.

	One part of the hierarchy will come from communal storage of food. Does the temples store food or does the city build it's own storage buildings?
	This will cause a layer in the hierarchy to form, but which group gets the power will be up to the player.
