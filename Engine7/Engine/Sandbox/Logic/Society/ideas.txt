	Have a barometer which says how sedentary the tribe is. The more sedentary the faster you research sedentary living technologies, but the more unrest you get. If the tribe is very sedentary you can't move the tribe as often, as you now have a need to stay at the same place.

	At some period in time you can cycle between tiles which have crops that need harvesting, sort of like manual crop rotation.

	Society grows because of the needs of people. When people are fed, they might yearn for shelter. When people have shelter they might yearn for religion.

	A form of hierarchy will eventually develop. It should be possible for the player to manipulate this, but not control it.
	The hierarchy will eventually develop into a form of government.
	The hierarchy and the people will have wants and desires which the player will need to attend to. People higher up in the hierarchy might force the player to do things that might not benefit everyone in the tribe/city.

	The heirarchy WILL form over time as a result of the player's actions. The player's actions can only control what the nation gets out of having the hierarchy.

	One part of the hierarchy will come from communal storage of food. Does the temples store food or does the city build it's own storage buildings?
	This will cause a layer in the hierarchy to form, but which group gets the power will be up to the player.
