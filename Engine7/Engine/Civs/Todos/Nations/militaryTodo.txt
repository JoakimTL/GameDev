Militaries

Available tactics depend on what the player has unlocked, but genius generals may use tactics more advanced than the player has unlocked.

Tactics are researched by either military training or during combat. Experience is how these tactics are researched. When a military is training the chance of discovering new tactics are higher than during combat.
The player can influence this by having a general staff during peace times.
