Mine Building Design Spec

A Mine is a facility that extracts raw ore, transports it, and refines it into concentrate. The game spans from 10000 BC to the modern era, with technologies unlocking by historical period. Concentration methods use universal tiers rather than ore-specific techniques.

Overview

Phases: Extraction → Transportation → Processing (Crushing → Concentration) → Output

Mine Types: Open-Pit, Shaft

Era Progression: Prehistoric, Bronze Age, Iron Age, Industrial, Modern

Extraction Methods & Era Unlocks
Choose one method when building; it affects base yield, cost, and terrain requirements.
- Open-Pit: Available from 10000 BC; medium yield; low cost; large footprint; short build time
- Shaft: Available from Bronze Age; low-to-high yield; medium-to-high cost; single-tile footprint; long build time

Extraction Modifiers by Era
These multipliers apply to extraction output; higher tiers unlock later.
- Basic Tools: 10000 BC; ×1.0 yield; no power required
- Bronze Tools: Bronze Age; ×1.2 yield; no power required
- Iron Tools: Iron Age; ×1.3 yield; no power required
- Steam-Powered Machinery: Industrial era; ×1.6 yield; medium power (steam)
- Electric Machinery: Modern era; ×2.0 yield; high power (electricity)
- Explosives: Industrial era; ×2.5 yield; no power; 5% collapse risk per use

Transportation Systems & Era Unlocks
Ore must be moved from extraction to processing. Select one transport type per mine.
- Porters/Carts: 10000 BC; low throughput; manual labor; no power
- Animal Wagons: Bronze Age; medium throughput; no power
- Steam Trains: Industrial era; high throughput; medium power (steam)
- Conveyor Belts: Modern era; very high throughput; medium power (electric)
- Truck Haulers: Modern era; very high throughput; high power (fuel)

Processing Stage 1 – Crushing
Crushers break ore into smaller pieces for concentration.
- Manual Crusher: 10000 BC; ×0.7 throughput; no power
- Stamp Mill: Bronze Age; ×1.0 throughput; low power (animal or steam)
- Roller Crusher: Iron Age; ×1.2 throughput; low power (water or steam)
- Ball Mill: Industrial era; ×1.4 throughput; medium power (steam)
- High-Speed Mill: Modern era; ×1.6 throughput; high power (electric)

Processing Stage 2 – Concentration (Universal Tiers)
General tiers improve recovery without specifying ore type.
- Primitive: 10000 BC; 50% recovery; no power (settling pits)
- Classical: Bronze/Iron Age; 65% recovery; low power (jigs, sluices)
- Mechanical: Industrial era; 75% recovery; medium power (steam-driven separators)
- Chemical: Industrial era; 85% recovery; high power (steam or electric); basic flotation and leaching
- Modern: Modern era; 90% recovery; high power (electric); advanced flocculation and leaching

By-Products & Events

Resource Drops: Small chance (1–5%) of bonus materials (e.g. metal shards) based on concentration tier

Pollution Events: Chemical and Modern tiers can create pollution, requiring treatment facilities

Collapse Risk: Using explosives in shafts carries a 5% chance per extraction cycle, halting operations briefly

Historical Progression & Balancing
Map technology unlocks to eras:
• 10000 BC: Basic Tools, Manual Crusher, Primitive Concentration, Porters/Carts
• Bronze Age: Bronze Tools, Stamp Mill, Classical Concentration, Animal Wagons
• Iron Age: Iron Tools, Roller Crusher, Classical Concentration
• Industrial Era: Steam-Powered Drills, Ball Mill, Mechanical and Chemical Concentration, Steam Trains
• Modern Era: Electric Machinery, High-Speed Mill, Modern Concentration, Conveyor Belts, Truck Haulers

Balancing Formula:
Final Output = BaseYield × ExtractionModifier × CrusherThroughput × (Recovery% ÷ 100)

Strategic & Environmental Notes

Later-technologies provide higher yield with smaller footprint

Early eras have low recovery, encouraging mine expansion

Chemical and Modern processing require pollution management

Faster transport and processing shorten vulnerability windows; defense planning is essential

Tailor values and event probabilities to your game’s balance and theme, and consider era-appropriate visuals and sounds for each upgrade.
