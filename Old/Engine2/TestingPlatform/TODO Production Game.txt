Factorio/Satisfactory inspired

- The player is an AI with only the knowledge on how to produce material. The knowledge of the AI can be expanded through chips scattered around the world.
- Started from nothing, except knowledge on modern production.
	- The player must create an axe, shovel, pickaxe (think minecraft)
	- Mining for resources and manually producing finished goods to create a factory.

- 3d Voxel world
	- Smooth world voxelation, EASY TO FLATTEN (Marching Cubes?)
		- Players voxels are hard edged, with exceptions (slopes, stairs, buildings) (Instanced voxels? Instanced meshes?)
	- Veins of material can be found throughout the world, early game the player is expected to scour the overworld for material.
	- A scanner can be made to scan for nearby resources.
- Player
	- The player is a robot with an artificial intelligence for a brain.
	- The player starts with no knowledge of the world it is put into, and must experiment with everything to figure out how the world works.
		- I.E. setting fire to wood to see if the wood is combustible. If the wood is combustible it is placed into the "solid" and "fuel" categories.
	- The player over time develops an inner monologue, which indicates what it knows.
		- This can be prompted by looking at something and pressing the "help" button. The help button should take into account everything the player has explored and discovered.
	- The player starts with a set of basic stuff on them, cybernetic style.
		- A mini smeltery, capable of smelting ore and forming them into ingots. Drains a lot of battery power however, if the player dies without a respawn point the map resets.
		- A battery pack, needed to sustain the player, as the player is a robot. The battery is drained doing mundane stuff like walking, building and jumping.
		- A mini generator, generates power using solid fuel.
- Construction
	- The player places strctures by determining what to build, based on what is on their hotbar
	- When placing a structure, the player builds the structure, which is time used by the player to build the structure. This is not too long, and the player can place blueprints instead and build the structures en masse instead of one by one.
	- The player can quickly create microbots to stay near the player, which removes the time aspect of building. The bots will only build nearby structures, and use resources from the players inventroy.
		- The player needs batteries on them to accomodate the bots.
- Power
	- Power is generated by a generator
		- Some generators have a long winding time
		- Generators:
			- Renewable
			- Non-Renewable
				- Coal
				- Gas
				- Oil
				- Nuclear Fission
					- 
	- BATTERIES
		- Used to quickly compensate for large power fluctuations if the grid has a lot of slow power generators (long winding time)
	- Power is transmitted through wiring, which can be attached to poles or other factory equipment (belts or pipes)
	- Power is received by machines, belts and belt sections
		- The power must be modulated by either the power generators or the machines, as excess unmodulated power will destroy the machines or the generator.
			- In the early game power is modulated by adding a modulator part before the machines, later the modulation is a requirement in construction of MOST generators.
			- Power Generation Modulators can also be added after the power generator, but before integration into the network, to modulate unmodulated power sources. This isn't available until later.
- Research
	- Researching is initially just exploring your surroundings, but later becomes a more scientific pursuit
	- Laboratory is later built to allow for deeper research into stuff, such as material sciences, electricity, etc...
- Production
	- Machines perform different tasks
	- 
- Create factory
	- Using conveyor belts, smelteries and autofactories.
		- Conveyor belts require power to operate
		- Smelters require power to operate, and input to smelt
		- Autofactories require power to operate, and input to transform into autofactured goods.
	- Power can be lead through wires, or through conveyor belts. Wires can also be attached to pipes, be make wiring things up more beautiful.
		- Resistors are needed 
	- Autofactored goods:
		- Plating
			- Iron
			- Copper
			- Steel
			- Aluminium
			- Titanium
			- ???
		- Wiring
			- Copper
		- Motor
			- AC
			- DC
				- Brushed
				- Brushless
		- Resistor
			- Used to lead the power to machines.
			- Many machines require resistors to be built
		- 
	- Microbots
		- Microbots help with building, they come in 2 phases:
			1: Player bots:
				- Attached to the player, and helps with building nearby structures using the player inventory.
			2: Microbot Centers:
				- Attached to the factory.
				- Has much longer range
				- Uses factory resources
				- Should be built using advanced belts, as the factory will request resources when the player builds.
		- Flying little bugs which help build the factory.
		- The player can create a microbot controller, which is basically a fance construction controller
			- When playing down a structure, the blueprint remains and the microbots builds it for the player.
			- If the microbots are upgraded, they will fetch resources automatically
- Defend against waves of wildlife
	- Starts with mechanical wolves and other smaller mechanical stuff.
	- Leads to large mechanical monsters attacking the player base.
	- Kills determine difficulty, with the difficulty being ever increasing.
	- Goal is to get off the planet, only for the game to reveal the player is stuck inside a simulation created by the creators of the AI to test the AI against previous iterations, showing an end game score based on speed, production quality (energy efficiency) and other factors leading to a goodd factory
