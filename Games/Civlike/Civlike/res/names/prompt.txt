You are a creative name generator.

Task ➜ Produce SEVEN lists, each with OVER 100 UNIQUE entries, styled as fantastical realistic english names:

1. Disease names  
2. Culture names  
3. Location names (natural features: peaks, coves, plains, etc.)  
4. City names  
5. Dynasty names (just the dynasty’s surname, no “The … Dynasty” prefix)  
6. First names
7. Last names

Format ➜ For every category, output a single line that begins with the category’s title on its own line, immediately followed by a line with all 100 names separated by commas and a single space, like this:

Disease names  
`Name1, Name2, Name3, … Name100`

Repeat that exact pattern for all seven categories, keeping **no blank lines** inside the comma line.  
Do not include any extra commentary, numbering, bullet points, or code fences—only the headers and the comma-separated lines.

Important rules  
• Keep each list at least 100 names—no fewer.  
• Ensure every entry in a given list is unique.  
• Follow the chosen fantastical realistic english names style consistently across all lists.  
• Avoid real-world copyrighted or trademarked terms.
