This document distils every design choice and mechanic discussed so far into a single narrative, rich with examples so a new reader can follow without the original chat. Paragraphs run long so Obsidian will handle wrapping; explicit line breaks are used only where Markdown structure needs them.

## 1 Cultures, Aspects, and Core Metrics

A **Culture** is a population‑level bundle of **Aspects**. Each Aspect tracks three averaged values: **Salience (S)** 0‑100 % – import­ance, **Polarity (P)** –100 %…+100 % – positive vs negative lean, and **Rigidity (R)** 0‑100 % – how fiercely the tradition is defended. Example: a city where 83 % of meals feature chilies might have Food‑Chili with S ≈ 83 %, P ≈ +92 % (people love it), R ≈ 18 % (still a fashion more than dogma).

### 1.1 Dynamic formulas

`ΔSal = DriftRate × (TargetSal – Sal)` gently pulls Salience toward its computed “rest position”. `ΔRig = RigidityGain × Sal × (1 – R/RigidityCap)` lets rigidity trail salience—no hard lag, but until S is high, R barely budges. By default RigidityCap = 50 %; building temples or courts via **Codify Tradition** can raise it to 90 %.

### 1.2 Target Salience drivers

`TargetSal = wRes·Availability + wMix·Immigration + wSyn·Synergy – wTen·Tension` where **Availability** measures local + imported resources, **Immigration** blends arriving populations’ averages, **Synergy/Tension** come from compatibility rules, and each `w*` weight is set per AspectType (food habits react quickly, religious dogma slowly).

## 2 Aspect Lifecycle

**Birth**: when a city performs a promoting _activity_ often enough (e.g., >0.1 chili meals per capita per year) a new Aspect spawns with S 5 %, P 0 %, R 0 % and the ruler chooses Embrace, Shun, Ignore, or Outlaw, which applies a 10‑year Pressure in the chosen direction. **Growth** uses the formulas above; sustaining S ≈ 80 % for 25‑30 y pushes R to ~40 %. **Codification** is not a button but the emergent result of building infrastructure (temples, courts, scripture workshops) whose upkeep costs gold, food, workforce, and unrest. Each instance nudges RigidityCap +2 % and adds soft positive Pressure that stabilises polarity. **Decline** occurs when resources vanish, opposing Aspects dominate, or negative Pressure persists; once S < 5 % and R < 10 % the Aspect dies and, if Writing tech exists, a **Fragment** is archived. **Rediscovery** events draw a Fragment centuries later; the player may Revive (keeping snapshot polarity), Repurpose (flip polarity), Ignore, or Outlaw. Revived Aspects restart at S 3 %, R min(10 %, oldR).

## 3 Compatibility & Synergy

Every antagonistic or synergistic pair lives in a `CompatibilityRule` subclass with its own `DoTick` routine. A hard Pacifism ↔ Militarism rule might add `tFac × S_Pac × S_Mil × (1+avgR)` Tension per month; a Cuisine‑Wines synergy might grant city Happiness bonus equal to `sFac × S_Cuisine × S_Wines`. Rule instances are registered via a reflection attribute—modders can drop new DLLs without editing data files.

## 4 Drift vs Pressure

**Drift** is automatic; **Pressure** is any time‑boxed external push `{duration, strength, unrestFactor, source}` that shifts S or P linearly while generating unrest equal to `strength × R × unrestFactor`. Examples: famine imposes –P on Wheat Foodstuff for 3 years; a trade treaty auto‑applies +P to the chili Aspect in both nations’ ports as long as spice caravans flow.

## 5 Monthly Cultural‑Crisis Loop

When total Tension across a culture exceeds a revolt threshold the game enters **Crisis** mode. Once per in‑game month a paused overlay appears listing high‑impact Aspects (rows) and key factions/cities (sidebar). The player allocates **Concession cards**—each with real resource costs and side‑effects—to Aspects they want to calm. Unrelieved Tension instantly spawns riots in linked cities and drags down those factions’ rolling **Satisfaction**. The aim is not to zero every pip but to keep city riots manageable and each faction above its revolt bar; compromise is acceptable. The panel re‑opens next month until global unrest / Satisfaction conditions are safe. Failure over several months can still escalate to Revolt (city flips temporarily) or Schism (splits culture).

#### 5.1 Example Concession cards

_Fund Festival_ (–Gold, +Relief, +Tourism, +Food demand), _Relax Tax_ (–Gold income 12 m, pleases Merchants, annoys Nobles), _Deploy Militia_ (–Food & Arms, force relief, may boost Militarism), _Subsidise Temple_ (construction + upkeep, permanent +RigCap 2 %). Cards are reusable each month as long as you can pay.

## 6 Spy Networks & Black Markets

Each city may host multiple **Markets** `{name, isLegal, allowedGoods, fee %, lawEnforcement}`. If an Aspect is outlawed yet demand/availability stays high, black‑market stalls automatically open (isLegal false). Players see only legal markets until they fund **Spy Network** levels: Intel 0—blind, Intel 1—rumour events, Intel 2—physical icons on city view, Intel 3—full volume/pricing plus the ability to play a _Police Sweep_ concession in Crisis mode, converting illicit flow into Relief at the cost of money, arms, and political backlash. Criminal factions or mega‑corps can found their own markets, interacting with treaties and wars like any other trade hub.
