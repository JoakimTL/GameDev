Buildings are located on Tiles and is used by cities to perform a function. Buildings by itself has a very transparent cost in the form of capital expenditure for initial construction and operational expenditure for maintenance and upgrades.
The cost of both are detemined by the city's building code, which the nation define. The building code essentially demands buildings be built in a certain way with certain materials.

I have yet to figure out how extensive this mechanic will be. It's such a rabbit hole to delve into, and I want to keep it maintainable. Early drafts went as far as having the player define what materials the facade should be built from.
The idea is fun in concept, but I don't want it to become tedious. I imagined a fully modular system where you could weigh the benefits of using certain materials versus the cost of using them, and ultimately choose based on that. What do you think?
