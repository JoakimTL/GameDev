# Legacy Continuity System – Design Specification (v0.3)

> **Purpose**: Define the mechanics allowing a player to retain control after total annexation by transferring their influence into an internal administrative body within the conquering nation. Also describes the persistence of legacy influence after collapse, and how history continues even after formal defeat.

---

## 1. Overview

When a player's nation is annexed, they do **not immediately lose** if a suitable **embedded successor** can be identified within the conquering polity. The player transitions to control of that entity, known as a **Legacy Continuity**.

This system preserves **narrative continuity**, maintains **player investment**, and reflects historical patterns of cultural survival through conquest.

Additionally, the game world acknowledges that history **does not stop with collapse**. Former powers can live on as memories, institutions, or revived movements within successor states. Empires may crumble, but life continues — players may return to prominence later through revolution, restoration, or cultural dominance.

---

## 2. Conditions for Legacy Seat Eligibility

At the moment of annexation, the engine scans for qualifying successor entities. A **Legacy Seat** offer is triggered if at least one administrative region within the annexing state meets or exceeds the following thresholds:

### 2.1 Evaluation Metrics

|Factor|Threshold (Default)|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|**Cultural Survival**|≥ 40% of population|Culture of former nation is majority in one region|
|**Elite Continuity**|Surviving dynasty/elite|Dynasties, governors, priests, bureaucrats|
|**Institutional Survival**|≥ 50% law match|Retained laws, religion, administrative structure|
|**Administrative Body**|Recognizable province|Distinct region retains historic/cultural identity|
|**Loyalty Potential**|≥ 60% Loyalty Score|Indicates manageable unrest within province|

If **no region** qualifies, the game ends (true annexation). If one or more qualify, the highest-scoring one becomes the Legacy Seat.

## 3. Post-Annexation Transition

### 3.1 Player Role Changes

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Previous Role|New Role in Legacy Seat|
|Head of State|Governor / Satrap / Magistrate|
|National Army Cmdr|Regional military commander|
|Foreign Policy Ctrl|None|
|Culture Influence|Strong within region|
|Trade Policy|Region-limited; can sway empire via demand|
|Lawmaking|Propose local laws; no empire-level veto|

### 3.2 Player Powers

- Control local **buildings**, **budgets**, and **trade posts**
    
- Influence **education**, **religion**, **public order**
    
- Administer **cultural policies** and **migration openness**
    
- Begin **resistance preparations** (see Section 8)
    

---

## 4. Integration With Other Systems

### 4.1 Culture

- Player’s original culture is tracked within the empire
    
- Cultural drift or repression modifies **Loyalty Score**
    
- May trigger **autonomy demands** or **rebellion events**
    

### 4.2 Laws

- Province retains a snapshot of old legal structure
    
- Can request re-enactment of traditions or institutions
    
- Law mismatches with imperial policy generate unrest
    

### 4.3 Trade and Market

- Retains regional market node
    
- Can attempt to corner niche trade or fuel internal demand
    

### 4.4 Diplomacy

- Player cannot direct empire diplomacy
    
- May **petition overlord**, form secret alliances with other governors, or fund rebel agents
    

---

## 5. UI and Player Feedback

### 5.1 Transition Event

- “Your nation has fallen, but your legacy lives on in [ProvinceName]”
    
- Option to accept control of the province or view collapse summary
    

### 5.2 Legacy Panel

- Lists:
    
    - Former nation’s capital, dynasty, and cultural ID
        
    - Surviving assets (elites, laws, faiths)
        
    - Loyalty, autonomy, and rebellion strength
        

### 5.3 Province HUD Changes

- Crest overlays ("Legacy Province")
    
- Flags identifying surviving culture
    
- Contextual tooltips for unrest: "Resentment over lost sovereignty"
    

---

## 6. Failure Conditions (True Game Over)

The player receives a **final defeat screen** when:

- No qualifying Legacy Seat exists after annexation
    
- Their Legacy Seat is dissolved or integrated fully (culture diluted, elites removed)
    
- A rebellion fails and the entire elite is purged
    

---

## 7. Cultural Match and Instant Integration

If the conqueror and the annexed territory share a high cultural match:

### Rule:

```
If (CultureMatchScore ≥ 0.9) AND (No Local Resistance):
    AnnexationStage → Integrated immediately
```

### Implication:

- Regions with a shared identity integrate immediately
    
- Others pass through annexation stages (Occupied → Provisional → Autonomous → Integrated)
    
- The player may only retain control if the region does not skip directly to "Integrated"
    

---

## 8. Resistance & Revival (Future Extension)

### 8.1 Resistance System

- Build underground support over time
    
- Smuggle arms, subvert imperial agents, propagate national myths
    
- Trigger uprising if Loyalty drops and Resistance ≥ 60%
    

### 8.2 Diaspora Mechanics

- Optionally found a **government-in-exile** if the player sets one up before annexation
    
- Exiled elites may resettle in trade hubs or allied lands
    
- Later reform a new nation based on cultural, religious, or dynastic lineage
    

### 8.3 Cultural Revival Path

- Survive long enough with autonomy and revive national identity
    
- Draft a new constitution, rename the province, or stage a ceremonial restoration
    

### 8.4 Post-Empire Continuity

- If the conquering empire **collapses**, any embedded legacy continuity can attempt to form a new state
    
- The game will check for: local loyalty, cultural memory, and institutional continuity
    
- The player's entity can seize the opportunity to ascend from internal subject to sovereign state again
    

> **Example**: The Roman Empire collapses. The player, who had survived as a provincial governor in Gaul, now leads a breakaway Gallic kingdom with inherited Roman traditions.

---

## 9. Future Systems

- **Compound Loyalty Score** blending culture, law, and economics
    
- **Succession Logs** showing continuity chain across regimes
    
- **Shared Legacy Diplomacy** (two players with historical ties cooperate under foreign rule)
    
- **Decadence and Collapse Triggers** for empires — informing when internal powers can rise
