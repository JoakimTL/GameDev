## Requirements
### Technology Requirements
- Twine Making
### Resource Requirements
- Plant Fibers _or_ Animal Fibers
## Progress Sources
- Repeated attempts to produce finer cord or thread
- Use of spindles, hand twisting, or other manual fiber alignment methods
- Textile-related crafting and experimentation
## Discovery Effects
- Enables conversion of fibers into thread or yarn
- Unlocks use of drop spindles and other primitive spinning tools
## Research Effects
- Unlocks recipe: Thread (from Plant or Animal Fibers)
- Increases thread quality and quantity per fiber unit
- Prerequisite for Manual Weaving, Dyeing, and advanced textile processes
