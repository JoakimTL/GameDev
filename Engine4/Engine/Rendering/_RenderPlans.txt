Meshes:

Needs {
	VAO
	VBOs {
		Indirect data
		Mesh data {
			Vertex data
			Index data
		}
		Instance Data
	}
}

BufferObject {
	Allocated memory on CPU side
	Can be read from by multiple threads at once
	Can only be written to by one thread at once
	Tightly controlled data. Cannot be accessed without creating a partition.
	Events fire indicating changes has been made to the allocated memory, listeners can do with it what they want.
	A method to read from the pointer without accessing the pointer outside the buffer must exist.
}

VBO {
	Allocated memory on GPU side
	Can only be written to. The data in the VBO comes from BufferObjects. It is synchronized every frame.
	Listens to the bufferobject, any changes registered is enqueued, and each frame the queue is emptied.

}

Vao {
	Instead of defining VAO based on struct types, define them based on VAO prototype factories, constructing parts of a VAO. A mesh should have the vertex data setup, while the scene data should have the instance data setup
}
