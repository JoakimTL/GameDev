Scaling of text is controlled by transform scaling (scaling of bounds) and text scale (scaling of characters inside bounds)
	- Think of transform scaling as resizing an image and text scaling as choosing the font size.
- Text rendering requires rendering to separate texture then rendering that texture.


- Linebreak causes new line
- Spaces can cause new line
- Wordwrap modes
	- None (No wrapping at all)
	- Auto (Scales the text to best fit the bounds, best suited for short texts)
	- Word (Wraps at the end of words)
	- Letter (Wraps whenever needed, might split words. This will give the text a rectangular shape)
- Selection
	- Selection will be multiple boxes that indicate what text has been chosen.
	- Holding alt while selecting will enable the rectangular selection shape (try it in vs2022)
	- Selection can be disabled
		- Discern between normal and rectangular selection?
	- Selection can be hidden
		- Discern between normal and rectangular selection?
	- Selected text can be copied into clipboard
		- With rectangular selection, new lines and spaces are added to maintain rectangular look when pasted. (assumed monospacing when adding spaces)
- Cursor
	- When text is clicked, the cursor position changes.
	- Arrow navigation for cursor
		- Holding CTRL allows the cursor to jump from word to word, rather than letter to letter
		- Holding CTRL+ALT allows the cursor to jump to the start of the line (left arrow) or end of the line (right arrow)
		- Holding SHIFT creates a selection
		- Holding SHIFT+ALT creates a rectangular selection
	- Cursor can be disabled
		- Disabled means the cursor can't be moved and clicking doesn't move it.
	- Cursor can be hidden
		- Hidden means the cursor is still there, but not visible
- Readonly mode
- Colorize and stylize text
