	Scenes
		Unsorted scene, used for 3d
			Uses sceneobjects
		Sorted scene, used for 2d
			Uses sorted sceneobjects (sceneobjects with a layer property)
	SceneObject
		Mesh (Sceneobjects with same shader and same VAO is bundled together)
		Material (does not affect where the object is placed in rendering)
		Shader (Sceneobjects with same shader is bundled together)
		Transparent (bool)
		SortedSceneObject
			Layer

		Volume density calculation
	Collision and Mechanics should be separated, and only combined when wanted
